Despite the cold, people will strip down to their swimwear and take a quick dip in the ice-cold water. Some even participate in organized events, such as races and competitions, to see who can swim the farthest or the longest.

In conclusion, despite the cold temperatures in Espoo, Finland, many residents embrace the winter weather through ice swimming.

### I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

*Great day*

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. I'm trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

1. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
2. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
3. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What?! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan

You mean it controls your actions? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
